# One-Nation-One-Health

The Nationwide Synced Pharmaceutical System (One Nation One 
Health-card) concept is designed to store the medical details such 
as prescriptions of patients which can be accessed by the patient 
anywhere within the country. Doctors also will have access to 
these records upon the respective patientâ€™s approval in order to 
provide quick and accurate diagnosis of the problem when 
required. This also reduces the amount of paper used which helps 
the environment and fixes storage problems. Patients can also 
place orders for medicines for which the vendors receive the orders 
through the system. The system is web application which can be 
accessed through any functional device with a web browser.
